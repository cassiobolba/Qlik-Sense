## Part 2 - Understanding The Data Modeling User Interfaces

### Data Model Viewer  

* While loading data from a data source, you can use the Data Profiling or not to help you to build the model;  
*  Using Data profiling does not create table connections instantly but offers the option of doing it on data manager, as well as allow bulk division and other edititings;

 </p> 

* If not using data profiling, the table connections are created automaticaly, and you have to edit on the data load editor changing field names  
* You can check the table relationship connected through lines

* Click in a table header and on preview button to check data quality specs for the table:
Table Metadata: # of rows and # of fields
Field Metadata: Density od field filled , Total distinct values, Present Distinct Values, Non-Null Values, Subset Ratio  
* Data manager is where you can connect tables trought recomended association

### Data Model Issues
**Circular Reference**
* When data is associated in a closed loop. Lead to data mishmatch.  
* You can solve by renaming the field you don't want as a key field, or braking association in  Data Manager  
**Synthetic Key**
* This is when there are more then one field as key field creating a composite key;   
* You can brake it on data manager by breaking the synthetic key;    
* you can also rename the field or concatenate them on data load editor;
